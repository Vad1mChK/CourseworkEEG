name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# 1. Trigger the workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger on pushes to the main branch (or 'master')
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering from the GitHub Actions UI

# 2. Define permissions required for deployment
# The GITHUB_TOKEN needs write access to the repository to push to the gh-pages branch.
permissions:
  contents: write
  pages: write
  id-token: write # Required for deployment to GitHub Pages environments

# 3. Define the Environment (optional, but good practice)
environment:
  name: github-pages
  url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
